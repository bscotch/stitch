		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_channel_num" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Undefined" Pure="true">
			<Description>With this function you can set how many audio channels are available for playing audio in GameMaker. What this basically means is that you give the number of simultaneous sounds that can be played at any one time, and if the number exceeds the amount, those sounds with a lower priority are stopped to free up a channel for the sounds with a higher priority. You can use this function to optimise your game for devices as the lower the number of channels for audio the better the performance, but bear in mind that this may also cause noticeable cut off of certain sounds if many are played at once.</Description>

		<Function Name="audio_create_stream" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Asset.GMSound" Pure="true">
			<Description>With this function you can create a new sound index which can then be used in the regular audio functions to stream audio directly from an external OGG file source. The function requires the filename (which can be an included file, for example) and will return the new sound index for use. Note that after you no longer need the sound you should call the function audio_destroy_stream() with the sound index to remove it from memory otherwise you may get a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.</Description>

		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_destroy_stream" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Undefined" Pure="false">
			<Description>If you have previously created an audio stream from a file using the function audio_create_stream() and no longer need that sound, you can call this function to delete it from memory. Any further calls to the sound index after it has been destroyed will give an error. It should be noted that this will free up the stream but on the target platform this may not show up in a memory manager. This is because GameMaker pools memory resources to prevent memory allocation overhead, and so the memory will remain allocated until required for something else or re-used for a new stream.</Description>
			<Parameter Name="filename" Type="String" Optional="false">The file to stream the audio from.</Parameter>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_exists" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Bool" Pure="true">
			<Description>This function returns whether a sound exists (true) or not (false). Note that if the index you search for has not been initialised previously, this function will cause an error as it is searching for non-existent asset indices. The sound to check can either be a single instance of a sound (the index for individual sounds being played can be stored in a variable when using the audio_play_sound() or audio_play_sound_at() functions) or a sound asset.</Description>

		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_falloff_set_model" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Undefined" Pure="false">
			<Description>To add more versatility to the audio engine, GameMaker permits you to select the falloff model that suits your game. This model will be used for all the audio functions in the game or app, and so you should make sure that the model you choose is the correct one, as each one will affect how the listener perceives the sounds you play through emitters or with the function audio_play_sound_at.</Description>
			<Parameter Name="model" Type="Constant.AudioFalloff" Optional="false">The constant used to set the falloff model.</Parameter>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_get_master_gain" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>With this function you can get the absolute value for the global volume of all sounds and music for a specific listener. The default listener index is 0, but you can use the function audio_get_listener_info() to get the different indices available for the target platform. The gain value returned is based on a linear scale from 0 (silent) to 1 (full volume). Note that on some platforms you can have a gain of greater than 1, although a value of 1 is considered &quot;full volume&quot; and anything greater may introduce audio clipping.</Description>
			<Parameter Name="listenerindex" Type="Id.AudioListener" Optional="false">The index of the listener to get the gain of.</Parameter>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_get_name" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="String" Pure="true">
			<Description>This function will return the name of a given audio resource as a string. The &quot;index&quot; value can be that of the resource itself (as seen in the Asset Browser) or the unique ID value that is given when you play the sound using, for example, audio_play_sound(). Note that the string returned is not the same as the resource ID and cannot be used to access the resource itself, so should only be used for displaying or error checking.</Description>
			<Parameter Name="index" Type="Id.Sound,Asset.GMSound" Optional="false">The index of the sound to check.</Parameter>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_get_type" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>When adding audio to GameMaker it can be either streamed or in memory.

			<Parameter Name="index" Type="Id.Sound,Asset.GMSound" Optional="false">The index of the sound to check.</Parameter>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_is_paused" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Bool" Pure="true">

		</Function>
		<Function Name="audio_master_gain" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Undefined" Pure="false">
			<Description>With this function you can set the absolute value for the global volume of all sounds and music. It is based on a linear scale from 0 (silent) to any value greater than 0, although normally you&apos;d consider the maximum volume as 1. Anything over 1 can be used but, depending on the sound used and the platform being compiled to, you may get distortion or clipping when the sound is played back. This function will affect the relative volume of all sounds and music played from within your game.</Description>

		<Function Name="audio_play_sound" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Id.Sound" Pure="false">
			<Description>With this function you can play any sound resource in your game. You provide the sound index and assign it a priority, which is then used to determine how sounds are dealt with when the number of sounds playing is over the limit set by the function audio_channel_num(). Lower priority sounds will be stopped in favour of higher priority sounds, and the priority value can be any real number (the actual value is arbitrary, and can be from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100, as GameMaker will prioritize them the same). Note that when dealing with priority, the higher the number the higher the priority, such that a sound with priority 100 will be favoured over a sound with priority 1. The final argument is for making the sound loop and setting it to true will make the sound loop until it is stopped and setting it to false will play the sound once only.</Description>

You can also use the keyword all to iterate through all the instances in a room, as well as a parent object to iterate through all the instances that are part of that parent / child hierarchy, and you can even specify an instance (if you have its id) as a check to see if it actually exists in the current room.

However, if the IDE has set the animation speed for the sprite used to be calculated as Frames Per Second, then the speed value given is a literal frames per second value, so setting this to 5, for example, will set the animation to loop 5 frames every second that the game runs. If the sprite used has no sub-images, this function will have no effect.</Description>

Normally you would assign these attachments in your animation program (Spine), but with this function you can create your own at run-time using a sprite asset from your game. the function requires that you give the attachment a UNIQUE name (as a string) and then set the sprite_index and image_index to use, as well as the x and y origin (which can be different to that defined by the sprite in the sprite properties), and you can also set any transforms that you wish to be applied to the image when attached. If the attachment was successfully created the function will return 1 and if it was not (you supplied an invalid sprite index, or the base sprite is not a Spine sprite) then it will return -1.</Description>

This function must be used to copy any sprites from the original assets before any transformations can be done on them. For example, if you wish to change the bounding box for a sprite, or set its alpha from another sprite, you must first duplicate it, then perform the operation on the duplicated sprite and use that. A duplicated sprite will be places on its own unique texture page when created, meaning that duplicating multiple sprites will create multiple texture pages and have an impact on performance, so use this function only when necessary.</Description>

		<Function Name="sprite_replace" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Undefined" Pure="false">
			<Description>This function works in almost the exact same manner as sprite_add(), only instead of returning the index of the sprite you are importing, it overwrites a previously created sprite index. When using this function you should use a sprite index that has been created and stored in a variable using other functions like sprite_add() or sprite_create_from_surface(), or even sprite_duplicate(), rather than a resource tree sprite asset. You can replace a sprite from the game assets using this function, but doing so means that you will lose the reference ID for the sprite that you are replacing, regardless of whether you call game_restart() or not, and so is not recommended. Regardless of the sprite being replaced, this function will create a new texture page for the sprite and so care should be taken when using it as it may adversely affect performance by increasing the number of required texture swaps for rendering.</Description>

The sprite that you are setting the alpha of cannot be a permanent resource, nor can the sprite you use to set the alpha, as this will give an error. This means that you must create two completely new sprites &quot;on the fly&quot; in some way for the function to work correctly. This can be achieved by using surfaces, or by creating a sprite from the screen (the code example below shows how the effect can be achieved with surfaces).</Description>

The available anti-aliasing levels are 0,2,4 and 8, with the default startup value being set to 0, and the default v-sync setting is false (off). Switching v-sync on may give a smoother gaming experience but it will also need more processing power and so its impact must be considered careful before use, and the same goes for the anti-aliasing where the higher the number the more processing that is required.</Description>

			<Description>This function will only affect things drawn in the Draw GUI Event and can be used to set a specific width and height for all GUI components in that event, and no matter what size of display or window is used to display the GUI, it will be scaled to fit correctly. Where the GUI is positioned (ie: the (0,0) position) will depend on whether you have used the function display_set_gui_maximise() or not. If you do not use this function (the default setting) then the GUI layer will be positioned with its (0,0) point at the same position as that for the application surface (the area where your game is being drawn) and the width and height will be stretched to fit the this surface, such that setting a GUI width of 256px with this function when the application surface is 512px would stretch those 256 pixels to fit, effectively making the pixels twice as large. This is ideal for those games that have aspect ratio correction set in the global Game Settings.</Description>

The delay time is calculated in 1/100ths of a second, but note that once the GIF has been created, if you use it for promotional purposes for example, different browsers may interpret the frame delay slightly differently - see here for more details. You may (optionally) supply X and Y offset values for the surface being used to add to the GIF, in which case the part drawn to the GIF will begin from the offset and not the default (0,0) position, permitting you to select only a section of the surface to add. You can also supply a quantization value, which is an integer between 0 and 3, where 0 is full quantization and 3 is zero quantization (lower values will have a subsequent degradation in quality, but create a smaller GIF). Note that there isn&apos;t much difference between the default quality of 2, and the highest of 3, and using 3 will significantly slow down the creation of the GIF so care should be taken when using the maximum value.</Description>

You may also specify an optional argument to set the &quot;clear colour&quot; for the GIF. This is an RGB value (no alpha component), and will clear the gif to this colour before anything is added to it. If you do not supply a clear colour argument, the default colour of black will be used.</Description>

The image captured will be the final render of the application surface of the game, or (if the app surface has been disabled) it will be an image of the whole display or window. It is important to note that the function is designed to be called in the Draw GUI End Event, which should give consistent results across all platforms. Using it in any other event may not work as expected, and may give different results across different targets and even devices.

			<Description>With this function you can change the size of the game window. If you use this function to change the size of the game window, the contents of the window will be scaled to fit with a 1:1 ratio to the background canvas which will keep the image crisp and clear (although scaled if the window is other than the room or view size). For example, if you have a 200 x 150 pixel window, and the player stretches the window by dragging the borders, the final window size may be 400 x 300 pixels, but the drawing canvas is STILL 200 x 150, which gives a blurred image as the pixel ratio is now 1:2. However, if you use this function to set the window size, the 1:1 ratio is maintained, even though the image is scaled to fit the new window size.</Description>

			<Description>When comparing values, for example when searching in a map or sorting a list, GameMaker must decide when two values are equal.

For example, it&apos;s possible that (5 / 3) * 3 will not be equal to 5! To help avoid this, a precision value is used on all real number functions, and when the difference between two numbers is smaller than this precision they are considered equal.

When this is enabled (true) all textures will be smoothed when drawn (this includes sprites as they too are considered textures), meaning that when scaled or moved if there is not a 1:1 pixel ratio then there will be a &quot;smudging&quot; across various pixels which may make images appear blurry depending on the art style used. If this is disabled (false) then images will be drawn based on the nearest pixel when scaled or moving which may lead to &quot;blocky&quot; images. The default value is false, and this can also be changed in the Global Game Options for individual target platforms.</Description>

			<Description>This function can be used to indicate to GameMaker whether textures should repeat (true) or not (false) when used for models and primitives. Normally texture widths and heights lie in the range 0 - 1, but if you specify a value larger than 1 by default the rest is not drawn (the entire texture will be drawn with an &quot;empty&quot; section corresponding to the percentage over 1 that is used. So a value of 2 for a texture width or height would draw the texture in half the space and leave the other half empty). However, by using this function to set repeat to true the texture is repeated automatically over all models and primitives. The likely use case for these functions is for repeating a texture in 3D but in order for it to work and not pull images from the rest of the texture page, the sprite used will need to be marked as being on a &quot;Separate Texture Page&quot; in the Sprite Editor.</Description>

			<Description>This function can be used to toggle z-buffer testing on or off, affecting how things will be drawn (in general only of use when working with 3D projects). Essentially, by default when z-testing is off and you have two objects drawing to the same space, both objects will be rendered regardless of whether one will over-draw the other, resulting in unnecessary draw calls. If you switch this on then the z-buffer is tested to see whether an object will be &quot;visible&quot; and not drawn if it&apos;s not. Note that this is the default behaviour, but you can change this by changing the type of comparison used for z-buffer testing (see the function gpu_set_zfunc().</Description>

			<Description>This function can be used to toggle on (true) and off (false) depth ordering using the z-buffer. When an instance is rendered in GameMaker , the depth of a generated pixel (its z coordinate) is stored in the z-buffer, then, if another instance of the scene must be rendered at the same pixel, the two depths are compared (z-testing - see gpu_set_ztestenable()) and the one &quot;closer&quot; to the observer is then saved to the z-buffer, replacing the old one. However, this is not always what you wish to happen and there are moments when you may want something to be drawn over everything else, no matter what its z value is. In those cases you can use this function to switch off writing to the z-buffer and so force whatever is being drawn to be drawn over everything else.

			<Description>This function allows you to set an emitter to stream a specific type of particle and is typically used the create event as it is a one off code that sets the emitter to generate the number of particles specified every step of the game there-after. The particles are emitted following the distribution, shape and position set by the function part_emitter_region(). You can set the number of particles being streamed to zero and call this function again to &quot;switch off&quot; the particle streaming, and the function will also accept negative numbers for the amount, in which case the emitter will produce particles based on random chance. For example, if you have the particle number set to -5, there is a 1:5 chance that a particle will be produced every step.

			<Description>This function draws the given sprite and sub-image at a position within the game room. For the sprite you can use the instance variable sprite_index to get the current sprite that is assigned to the instance running the code, or you can use any other sprite asset. The same goes for the sub-image, as this can also be set to the instance variable image_index which will set the sub-image to that selected for the current instance sprite (note, that you can draw a different sprite and still use the sub-image value for the current instance), or you can use any other value for this to draw a specific sub-image of the chosen sprite. If the value is larger than the number of sub-images, then GameMaker will automatically loop the number to select the corresponding image (for example, if the sprite being drawn has 5 sub-images numbered 0 to 4 and we set the index value to 7, then the function will draw sub-image 3, numbered 0). Finally, the x and y position is the position within the room that the sprite will be drawn, and it is centered on the sprite x offset and y offset.</Description>

To that end, you must have defined the canvas element correctly within the *.html page of your game using the correct sizes and names that correspond to the surfaces you wish to create. So, you would have your &quot;main&quot; canvas, and then your secondary surface canvas elements, which will be assigned using this function to the correct surfaces.

If you are running this on a the HTML5 or PC and Mac modules then this value is updated constantly, as long as the device (usually a mouse) is plugged in, however for mobile devices, this will only be updated while the screen is being touched, and note that the maximum number of touches that can be detected will depend very much on the device being used and the OS it runs. Also note that on HTML5 only &quot;device 0&quot; will function correctly and other devices may give wrong values.</Description>

		<Function Name="keyboard_set_map" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Bool" Pure="false">
			<Description>Sometimes when making a game you may wish one key to do the same as another. For example many people use the keys WASD for movement, but then many people also use the arrow keys! So, what to do? Well, you could code the movement system twice, but that is a bit complicated and thankfully redundant as this function permits you to &quot;map&quot; one key to another and so any input from either key will be interpreted as the same. To do this you choose a key that you want to map (key2 - this will be the key that you write the code for) and a key that you want it to be mapped to (key1). After that, keypresses to either key will be interpreted by GameMaker as coming from key2. You can also use this function to design a system where the user can define their own keys for playing by simply mapping the user input key to the key that you have coded into the game.</Description>

			<Description>This function is similar to the log2(n) function, only that log10(n) gets the number of 10&apos;s that we need to multiply together to get n. So log10(100) returns 2, as multiplying 10 by itself gives 100, log10(1000) returns 3 as 10x10x10=1000 etc... The number does not have to be divisible by ten, however, but this will still return an appropriate value, for example if we have log10(101) we get 2.00432137... which is how many times you could divide 101 by 10.</Description>

			<Description>This function basically asks &quot;how many 2&apos;s do you need to multiply to get n?&quot;. A common example of use in programming would be to calculate the number of bits that are needed to represent a number. To do this we calculate the log2(x) of the number, round it down and add 1 - for example log2(100) returns 6.643856, which rounded down is 6, to which we add one and it gives us 7. So we need 7 bits to represent 100. It can also be used for describing exponential growth or decay, and is often called a binary logarithm.</Description>

			<Description>Epsilon is a value used to determine whether two numbers subject to rounding error are close enough to be considered &quot;equal&quot;. It is useful when dealing with floating point maths as it can reduce the &quot;rounding errors&quot; that make certain operations return values that appear incorrect or contrary to what we expect. For example, we may have added a value to the image index of a sprite and expect the result to be a single integer, but due to the nature of floating point maths, the actual final value ends up being something like 5.0000002, so when we have the following check:</Description>

		<Function Name="mean" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>This function works by adding up all the input values and then dividing them by their own number.

		<Function Name="median" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>This function returns the median of the input values, that is, the middle value. When the number of arguments is even, the smaller of the two middle values is returned and the function can have as many arguments as required (note that more arguments will mean that the function will be slower to parse) which must all be real values. This means that, for example, median(43, 12, 25, 19, 6) would return 19 as it is the middle value between all the rest.</Description>

		<Function Name="randomise" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Locale="GB" Pure="false">
			<Description>This function sets the seed to a random value. Should you need to keep a consistent value over a number of runs of a game, you should be using random_set_seed(). Please note, that when using the random number functions in GameMaker the initial seed is always the same, as this makes tracing errors and debugging far easier. Should you wish to test with true random, you should call this function at the start of your game. The function will return the new randomised seed value (an unsigned 32bit integer).</Description>

		<Function Name="random_get_seed" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>To generate a random number GameMaker starts with a random seed number. With this function you can retrieve that seed, which can then be stored to reproduce a specific series of random events. For example, say you have a procedurally generated game, but want the player to be able to go back to previously discovered areas. Well, at the start of each area, you can store the random seed with this function and so every time you need to go back there, you can use random_set_seed() to set the seed to what it was previously and so force GameMaker to reproduce the same set of &quot;random&quot; functions that it used previously.</Description>
		</Function>
		<Function Name="random_range" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>This function returns a random number between the specified range, and this return value does not need to be an integer.

			<Description>To generate a random number GameMaker starts with a random seed number. With this function you can set that seed to a known value and so &quot;force&quot; the outcome of all random events afterwards to be the same every time the program is run. For example, this function can be used in conjunction with random_get_seed() to create procedurally generated content and save the results without having huge savegames (you save the seed only, no need for anything else). Should you need truly random results for everything, you should be using the randomise() function.</Description>

		<Function Name="round" Deprecated="false" ReturnType="Real" Pure="true">
			<Description>Just as it says, round() takes a real number and rounds it up or down to the nearest integer. In the special case where the number supplied is exactly a half-integer (1.5, 17.5, -2.5, etc), the number will be rounded to the nearest even value, for example, 2.5 would be rounded to 2, while 3.5 will be rounded to 4. This type of rounding is called bankers rounding and over large numbers of iterations or when using floating point maths, it gives a statistically better rounding than the more traditional &quot;round up if over .5 and round down otherwise&quot; approach.</Description>

			<Description>The mp_potential_ functions do their work using a number of parameters that can be changed using this function. Globally the method works as follows: it first tries to move straight towards the goal, looking a number of steps ahead which can be set with the parameter &quot;ahead&quot; (default value is 3). Reducing this value means that the instance will start changing direction later as it doesn&apos;t &quot;see&quot; as far ahead, and increasing it means it will start changing direction earlier. If this check leads to a collision then it starts looking at directions more to the left and to the right of the ideal, straight-line direction. It does this in steps of size &quot;rotstep&quot; (default value is 10), and reducing this gives the instance more movement possibilities but will be slower as it needs more processing power.</Description>

			<Description>There will be certain instances in a physics based game which you want to move around but do not wish to be acted on by forces such as gravity, nor forces incurred by collisions with dynamic objects (think of moving platforms in a platform game, for example). For such objects simply setting the density of a fixture to 0 will mean that the physics will assume that the object is intended to be static. However, should you set the phy_speed_x, phy_speed_y or phy_angular_velocity variables for an instance that has had such a fixture bound to it, it will be converted into a kinematic object and begin movement. Change the instance from static to kinematic mid-simulation can be expensive in terms of processing (depending on the state of the instances in the physics world) and therefore it is recommended to set the fixture to be kinematic using this function prior to binding it to an instance, so that it will be unaffected by collisions and forces (such as gravity) but may move with constant linear and/or angular velocity.</Description>

How much torque you apply to get the desired rotation all depends on the size and density of the fixture you assign to your instance, as both these properties go towards defining its mass, which defines its inertia, which affects torque! The general rule of thumb is that if an instance has a lot of inertia, you will need a lot of torque to get it to start rotating.

			<Description>Normally for a physics simulation to work, it must be continuous and cannot be stopped and started, or have instances suddenly moved from one place to another in the room. However, there are moments when you need to pause the simulation as (for example) the device os has paused, and so you would use this function. It pauses the simulation if the flag is set to true and no further physics calculations will be done until the flag is set to false again.</Description>

Sometimes the problem can be in the rendering part of your game, for example a sprite may be drawn at the wrong position or rotation, giving the appearance of incorrect physics, or it may be that your calculations are not correct. Either way, this function will help you to find and resolve the problem by drawing what is going on in your physics system. To do this, you need tell it which part of the system to draw, and this is done by passing a value created from the bits stored in various &quot;flag&quot; constants:</Description>

The default number for the physics system is 10, but this can be changed to higher or lower depending how many times you want the physics to calculate each step, but it is recommended that you set this no lower than 5 and no higher than 30. You should also be aware that this function is dependent on the physics_world_update_speed() function.</Description>

However, for the physics functions that may not be enough and you may want things to be updated at a slightly faster speed to increase stability or precision. To that end we use the function physics_world_update_speed() which sets the update speed for the physics system independently of the room speed. This means that you could have a room speed of 30, but set the physics to 60, effectively doubling the speed at which the physics system updates and performs its calculations compared to the speed at which the step are updated.</Description>

Note that if you pass the function a struct literal (ie: a struct that was created without using a constructor function) then it will simply return the string &quot;struct&quot;. This function can also be used to check if a struct reference is a weak reference or not, in which case the function will return the string &quot;weakref&quot; instead of the name of the function that created the struct for more information, see the function weak_ref_create()).</Description>

			<Description>This function defines the position of a textured vertex for a primitive. The final look of the primitive will depend on the primitive type chosen to draw (See draw_primitive_begin() for more information), the order with which you add the vertices to it, the position of the start and end points that you give for the texture sample and the colour and alpha values that you have set. To maintain the texture appearance while changing only the alpha, a value of -1 (or c_white) may be used for the colour argument. To end and draw the primitive you must call draw_primitive_end().</Description>

	<Variables>
		<Variable Name="font_texture_page_size" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This built-in variable can be used to either get or set the texture page size when using the function font_add(). On adding a font using that function, GameMaker will create a texture page cache of the required glyphs up to the size defined by this variable. The process is as follows:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="instance_count" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">With this read only variable you can get a count of all active instances that are in the room. This will include the instance running the code, but does not include those instances that have been deactivated using the instance deactivate functions. Note that this variable will only give you the number of instances at the start of the step, so any changes to the instances in the room made after the step has started will not be taken into consideration.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="instance_id" Type="Array[Id.Instance]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only array holds all the ids of every active instance within the room. This means that if you have used any of the Instance Deactivate functions those instances that have been deactivated will not be included in this array (if you have used a value from this array previously, it will now return the keyword noone).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="alarm" Type="Array[Real]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This 1 dimension array is used to get the current value for any alarms that the instance may have, or it can be used to set those alarms. There are twelve alarms built into each instance of an object, and each one has its own event that will run when this variable reaches 0.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="depth" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">When you create an object you can assign it an initial depth which defines how the instances of that object will be drawn in the room when the game is being played and this variable can be used to get and to change that depth value while the game is running. You would normally not need to use this variable as you should be setting instances to be added to discreet layers, which in turn are set to a specific depth, but it may be that you want to change the depth of an instance using this value, in which case a &quot;temporary layer&quot; will be created specifically for the instance at the given depth. Note that when no instances are on the same depth then this temporary layer will be removed from memory (unlike regular layers which will remain even if they have nothing on them).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="direction" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">All instances in GameMaker have certain &quot;built in&quot; properties that you can use and set to govern how they look and behave. Direction is one of those properties and can be used to set the direction of movement of the instance when the instance has a speed other than 0. Note that directions in GameMaker are usually calculated as 0° being right, 90° being up, 180° being left and 270° being down, and that the gravity and gravity_direction variables can modify the direction value when they are used in your games.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="friction" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">Friction is one of the &quot;built in&quot; properties that instances can have and can be used to slow the instance down over time when the speed is other than zero. It works simply by subtracting an amount from the speed every step until the object has a speed of 0, so if the friction is set to, for example, 0.1 and the speed of the instance is 1 (1 pixel per step), it will slow down and stop after 10 steps have passed. Note too that the friction is applied to positive and negative speeds equally with the net result always being that the object has a speed of 0 after a given time.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="gravity" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">gravity is one of the &quot;built in&quot; variables all instances have and, when set, will apply a constant force in the gravity_direction of the instance, influencing both the instance speed and direction. Note that gravity is a cumulative force and will accelerate the object if you choose not to cap the final speed, and it&apos;s usual that you&apos;d set this variable to small decimal values like 0.01. If you set the gravity to 0, then no gravity will be applied to the instance (this is the default value).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="gravity_direction" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">gravity_direction is one of the &quot;built in&quot; properties all instances have and can be used to set the direction of movement when the instances gravity is greater than 0. Note that directions in GameMaker are usually calculated as 0° being right, 90° being up, 180° being left and 270° being down.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="hspeed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">hspeed is one of the &quot;built in&quot; properties that all instances have and defines the horizontal movement speed (along the x-axis) of the instance in pixels per step. So, an hspeed of 3 means 3 pixels of movement to the right (+x) every step, and an hspeed of -3 would mean 3 pixels of movement to the left (-x) every step.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="id" Type="Id.Instance" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable holds the unique identifying number for the instance. Every instance that you create - whether through code or by adding them to a room in the Room Editor - is given a number that is used internally to identify this instance and the variable id is what you can use to reference it. The id is also returned (and can be stored in a variable) when an instance is created using instance_create_layer() or instance_create_depth(), as well as other instance functions.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="layer" Type="Id.Layer" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This built-in variable is created for every instance in a room and contains the layer ID value of the layer that the instance is assigned to. This value can then be used in other functions like layer_get_depth() or it can be changed to move the instance to another layer, but note that if the layer being assigned does not exist in the current room, then you will get an error that will force your game to close. When assigning a layer, you must supply the unique layer ID as returned by the function layer_get_id() (when using named room layers), or as returned by the function layer_create() (when you create your own layers at run time).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="persistent" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be read to find out if the instance is flagged as persistent or not, or it can used to set persistence to true (persistent) or false (not persistent) for the instance. A persistent instance is one that will be &quot;carried over&quot; from room to room, meaning (for example) that it only has to be created once at the start of the game and it will be present in all further rooms. Care should be taken with persistence as it is easy to lose track of persistent instances which can lead to problems later in the development of the game.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="solid" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">An instance can be flagged as solid through the object properties in the Object Editor, or by changing the value of this built-in variable. If solid is set to true then, when a collision is detected, the colliding instance is returned automatically to the position it was at in the step previous to the collision (and then any code or actions are run in the collision event). If it is set to false, all positioning must be dealt with through the collision event.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="speed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">All instances in GameMaker have certain &quot;built in&quot; properties that you can use and set to govern how they look and behave. speed is one of those properties and defines how many pixels the instance will move every step. Unlike hspeed and vspeed, speed has no direction associated with it as this is governed by the direction value of the instance, but it can have a negative value, in which case the instance will travel in the opposite direction to that set by the direction function (ie: direction - 180°). Note that setting the speed and/or the direction, will also modify the values of the hspeed and vspeed variables, and that gravity, gravity_direction and friction can all modify the value of this variable when they are used in your games.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="visible" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">An instance can be flagged as visible or not by setting this variable to true (visible) or false (invisible). This works by telling GameMaker to skip the draw event for this instance, so care must be taken when using this as it means that no code placed in the draw event will be run while the instance is not visible. Also note that if the layer that the instance is assigned to is flagged as invisible, setting this variable to true will have no effect until the layer itself is flagged as visible too.</Variable>
        <Variable Name="managed" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false" FeatureFlag="rollback">This read-only variable indicates whether the object is managed by the rollback multiplayer system or not.</Variable>
        <Variable Name="vspeed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">vspeed is one of the &quot;built in&quot; properties that all instances have and defines the vertical movement speed (along the y-axis) of the instance in pixels per step. So, a vspeed of 3 means 3 pixels of movement to the bottom (+y) every step, and a vspeed of -3 would mean 3 pixels of movement to the top (-y) every step.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">The x value of an instance is the horizontal position in the current room, measured in pixels. This value can be either 0, positive or minus, where 0 is the left hand side of the room and moving right increases x, moving left decreases x (a negative value for x means that the instance has gone outside the left side of the room). You can even give x a real value like 12.345, but as you cannot get .345 of a pixel, the instance may not appear to have moved, although these values will be maintained and used internally by GameMaker and are perfectly valid.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="xprevious" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This built-in variable returns the previous x position for the instance. This variable will be set just before the start of the begin step event but it can also be set through code at any time, meaning you can give it your own custom value should that be necessary.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="xstart" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable stores the initial x position of the instance when it is first created in the room. This is not a read-only variable and can be set as well as read.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="y" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">The y value of an instance is the vertical position in the current room, measured in pixels. This value can be either 0, positive or minus, where 0 is the top of the room and moving down increases y, moving up decreases y (a negative value for y means that the instance has gone outside the top of the room). You can even give y a real value like 12.345, but as you cannot get .345 of a pixel, the instance may not appear to have moved, although these values will be maintained and used internally by GameMaker and are perfectly valid.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="yprevious" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This built-in variable returns the previous y position for the instance. This variable will be set to the current x position just before the start of the begin step event but it can also be set through code at any time, meaning you can give it your own custom value should that be necessary.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="ystart" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable stores the initial y position of the instance when it is first created in the room. This is not a read-only variable and can be set as well as read.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="object_index" Type="Asset.GMObject" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the index of the object that the instance has been created from. This is not the same as the object name, which is a string and can be found using object_get_name(), as this function returns the index number, which is a unique value that GameMaker assigns to every object at the time of creation.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="event_number" Type="Constant.EventNumber" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the number of the event currently being called, where the number is actually referring to the &quot;sub event&quot; of the event, ie: for the step event the event number could be any one of the constants ev_step_normal, ev_step_begin, or ev_step_end. For a full list of constants that are available for the specific sub-events see event_perform(), and if you should need to know the main event itself, you should be checking the event_type.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="event_object" Type="Asset.GMObject" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns object index of the instance which is running the event being checked.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="event_type" Type="Constant.EventType" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the type of event currently being executed, which can be one of the following constants:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_endaction" Type="Constant.PathAction" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get or to change the reaction of an instance when it reaches the end of the current path. Normally you would set this when you start the path using path_start() but you may wish to change this behaviour depending on any number of events in your game. The available values are expressed using the following constants:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_index" Type="Asset.GMPath" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">All resources in GameMaker have a unique identifying number, and the path_index is a read-only variable that holds the index value for a given path resource that has been assigned to an instance using the path_start() function. If the instance has no path assigned, the variable will be set to -1.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_orientation" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable holds the current orientation of the path that has been assigned to the instance when the function path_start() was called. When a path is created, its orientation is the default 0 degrees, but you can set this value to anything you wish using this. Remember that in GameMaker (unless you are using physics) the angles are calculated counter-clockwise, so setting the path orientation to 90° would rotate the path to the left.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_position" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This function can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along a path. The value is normalised from 0 - 1, so if you set it to, for example, 0.5, the instance will be moved to exactly the middle of the path.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_positionprevious" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along its current path in the previous step, and is a normalised value between 0 and 1 ie: 0 is the start position of the path and 1 would be the end position. It is similar to the xprevious and yprevious variables in how it works, only it is specific for paths. It can be useful for things like temporarily stopping a path follower if something is in the way (see the example code below).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_scale" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This value can be used to get or to set the scale of the currently assigned path for the instance (as set by the function path_start()) with a default value of 1. This is a scalar value, so 1 is a scale of 1:1, while setting it to 2, for example, will be double the scale and setting it to 0.5 would be halving the scale.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="path_speed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">You can use this function to get or to set the speed of a path after it has been started using the function path_start(). You can use negative values to signify that the instance should follow the path in reverse.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room" Type="Asset.GMRoom" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable holds the room index for the current room that your game is running. This is not a read only variable, however changing this will not change the index value for the current room, but rather change the room to match the index that you have set the variable to. Care should be taken when doing this as if the index you change the variable to is not valid the game will throw an error and close. In general it is much better practice to use room_goto() to change rooms.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room_first" Type="Asset.GMRoom" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the index of the very first room in the game (this is defined by the order in which the rooms appear in the Room Manager and not by the order in which they were created).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room_height" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable holds the height of the current room in pixels. You can change this variable to change the height of the room at any time, and changes will be applied to the bottom of the room, as the origin is considered to be the top left corner. So, for example, if the room is 480px in height and you set it to 640px, the room will be expanded downwards with an extra 180px added to the bottom.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room_last" Type="Asset.GMRoom" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the index of the very last room in the game (this is defined by the order in which the rooms appear in the Room Manager and not by the order in which they were created). Note that this variable will not recognise or take into consideration rooms that have been added dynamically using room_add() or room_duplicate().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room_persistent" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable can be used to get and to set the persistent flag for the current room. If set to true the room is considered persistent, in which case each time you leave the room and come back again the state of the instances within that room will have been maintained. However if it is flagged as false, each time you return to the room it will be reset to its initial state. You should note that a persistent room uses considerably more memory than a normal room and it is not recommended to have too many of them in your game.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="room_width" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable holds the width of the current room in pixels. You can change this variable to change the width of the room at any time.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="in_sequence" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This is a built-in variable that is part of the instance variables created for every object instance in your game. If the instance is being controlled by a sequence, this variable will return true, otherwise it will return false. This is a read-only variable and cannot be changed.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sequence_instance" Type="Struct.SequenceInstance" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This is a built-in variable that is part of the instance variables created for every object instance in your game. If the instance is being controlled by a sequence, this variable will hold the sequence instance struct for the Sequence controlling the instance, otherwise it will be undefined. This is a read-only variable and cannot be changed.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="drawn_by_sequence" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This is a built-in variable that is part of the instance variables created for every object instance in your game. This can be changed at any time but will only affect behaviour when the instance is being controlled by a sequence. In this case if this variable is set to true then the sequence will handle the drawing order of the instance, otherwise normal instance drawing will occur.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="bbox_bottom" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the y position (within the room) of the bottom of the bounding box for the instance, where the bounding box is defined by the maximum width and height of the mask for the instance (as set by the sprite_index or by the mask_index). Even when a sprite has a precise collision mask, the bounding box exists and is used for certain things, and so you can use this variable to find it. Please note that when the instance has no sprite assigned the value returned will be the same as the instance Y position.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="bbox_left" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the position (along the x-axis) within the room of the left hand bounding box for the instance, where the bounding box is defined by the maximum width and height of the mask for the instance (as set by the sprite_index or by the mask_index). Even when a sprite has a precise collision mask, the bounding box exists and is used for certain things, and so you can use this variable to find it. Please note that when the instance has no sprite assigned the value returned will be the same as the instance X position.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="bbox_right" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the position within the room (along the x-axis) of the right hand side of the bounding box for the instance, where the bounding box is defined by the maximum width and height of the mask for the instance (as set by the sprite_index or by the mask_index). Even when a sprite has a precise collision mask, the bounding box exists and is used for certain things, and so you can use this variable to find it. Please note that when the instance has no sprite assigned the value returned will be the same as the instance X position.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="bbox_top" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the position within the room (along the y-axis) of the top of the bounding box for the instance, where the bounding box is defined by the maximum width and height of the mask for the instance (as set by the sprite_index or by the mask_index). Even when a sprite has a precise collision mask, the bounding box exists and is used for certain things, and so you can use this variable to find it. Please note that when the instance has no sprite assigned the value returned will be the same as the instance Y position.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_alpha" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable is used to get or to set the alpha value for the sprite. Alpha is always calculated as a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either no draw event (and so GameMaker will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the extended drawing functions like draw_self() or draw_sprite_ext().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_angle" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This value sets the angle (rotation) of the sprite and is measured in degrees, with the right being 0º, up being 90º, left being 180º and down being 270º. Set this variable to 0 to reset the sprite to be drawn as was defined in the sprite editor. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either no draw event (and so GameMaker will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the extended drawing functions like draw_self() or draw_sprite_ext().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_blend" Type="Constant.Color" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable controls the &quot;tinting&quot; of the instance sprite and the default value is -1 (but can also be c_white). Any other value (including internal colour constants like c_red, or c_aqua) will blend the specified colour with the original sprite. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either no draw event (and so GameMaker will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the extended drawing functions like draw_self() or draw_sprite_ext().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_index" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">A sprite is made up of one or more sub-images which can make the sprite appear animated as they switch from one to the other, or can they can be switched between in code to give different &quot;states&quot;, much like a button has in windows. If the sprite is animated, then you can get the current frame of the animation by checking the image_index variable, or if you want to change the state of a static sprite, you can select a new sub-image by setting this variable to the desired sub-image of the sprite. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either no draw event (and so GameMaker will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the drawing functions like draw_self() or draw_sprite_ext() (by supplying the image_index into the appropriate argument).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_number" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable can be used to get the number of sub-images in a sprite that has been assigned to an instance (if you need the number of sub-images for a sprite other than the one assigned to the instance you should use sprite_get_number()). Please note that when there is (for example) 1 sub-image this variable will return &quot;1&quot; but the image_index of that sub-image is 0.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_speed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable determines the speed in which GameMaker will cycle through the sub-images for the current instance sprite. The speed value given is a multiplier, with 1 being the default value, and setting it to 0.5 will half the animation speed - as set in the Sprite Editor or Image Editor- while setting it to 2 will double it. If the sprite used has no sub-images, this variable will have no effect.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_xscale" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This value sets the horizontal scaling applied to the sprite that has been assigned to the current instance. A scale of 1 indicates no scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the width of the sprite), larger values will scale up and negative values will flip the sprite and scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the sprite is just flipped about its origin with no scaling).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="image_yscale" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This value sets the vertical scaling (along the y-axis) applied to the sprite that has been assigned to the current instance. A scale of 1 indicates no scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the height of the sprite), larger values will scale up and negative values will mirror the sprite and scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the sprite is just mirrored along the y-axis with no scaling).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="mask_index" Type="Asset.GMSprite" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">When you define an object in GameMaker you can assign it a mask to be used for collisions rather than the one that corresponds to the defined sprite. This variable can be used to find the sprite_index of that mask (or it will return -1 if no sprite has been assigned) or to set the mask for an instance to the chosen sprite. Setting the mask index means that you can have, for example, a sprite for the instance with an irregular shape, yet give it a circular collision mask that is gotten from a different sprite.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sprite_height" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the height of the sprite that has been assigned to the instance. This height is returned in pixels and will be dependent on the image_yscale. If you need the un-scaled height you should use sprite_get_height().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sprite_index" Type="Asset.GMSprite" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable returns the index of the current sprite for the instance, or -1 if the instance has no sprite associated with it. You can change it to give the instance a different sprite by giving it the name of a sprite from the resource tree or by using a variable that has an externally loaded sprite indexed in it. Changing the sprite does not change the index of the currently visible frame, so if you change the sprite on frame number 3, the new sprite will be drawn with that frame visible (assuming it has the same number of frames).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sprite_width" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the width of the sprite that has been assigned to the instance. This width is returned in pixels and will be dependent on the image_xscale. If you need the un-scaled width you should use sprite_get_width().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sprite_xoffset" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the local xoffset (the x component of the origin as defined in the sprite editor) of the sprite that has been assigned to the instance. This xoffset is returned in pixels and will be dependent on the image_xscale, so that (for example) if a square 32x32 sprite is defined as having the x origin at 16, when that sprite is scaled by 2 this variable will return 32. If you need the un-scaled xoffset you should use sprite_get_xoffset().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="sprite_yoffset" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read only variable returns the local yoffset (the y component of the origin as defined in the sprite editor) of the sprite that has been assigned to the instance. This yoffset is returned in pixels and will be dependent on the image_yscale, so that (for example) if a square 32x32 sprite is defined as having the y origin at 16, when that sprite is scaled by 2 this variable will return 32. If you need the un-scaled yoffset you should use sprite_get_yoffset().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="timeline_index" Type="Asset.GMTimeline" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable holds the index of the time line currently associated with the instance. You can set this to a particular time line to use that one, or set it to -1 to stop using a time line for the instance (if no time line is defined for the instance, -1 is returned too). Note that this does not start the time line - for that use the variable timeline_running.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="timeline_loop" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable will return whether the time line is looping (true) or not (false). You can change this variable to switch looping on or off and it works with a negative time line speed (if the time line position goes below 0 it will start again at the last defined moment).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="timeline_position" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable holds the current position (moment) a time line is currently at. You can change this value to skip parts of the time line, or to repeat parts or to start the time line again from the beginning.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="timeline_running" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable holds current state of the assigned time line and will return true if it is running and false if it is not. You can also set this variable to either true or false to start and stop the time line at any time. it should be noted that a stopped time line is not reset, and so starting it again at a later time will start it from the exact moment that it was stopped at.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="timeline_speed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">Normally, in each step the position in the time line is increased by 1, however you can change this amount by setting this variable to a different value. You can use real numbers (like 0.5, or 2.4 for example) and if the value is larger than one, several moments can happen within the same time step (they will all be performed in the same order as defined for the time line, so no actions will be skipped).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_camera" Type="Array[Id.Camera]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This array holds the unique camera ID assigned to the given view port, and can be set to a new camera or read to get the current camera, returning -1 if no camera is assigned. You can have up to 8 view ports active in a room (array values 0 through 7), and can assign a camera to any of them by simply setting this variable to the camera ID value (as returned by the functions camera_create() or camera_create_view()). If you have set the camera to a view port through the Room Editor, this variable will hold the camera ID for that port.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_current" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable is only valid in the Draw Event and returns the current view port being rendered. The return value will change during the draw event when you have various views as the draw event is called once for each view port in succession. So when (for example) you are using view port[0] and view port[1] in your game room, the draw event for ALL instances will be run twice, once for each port, and with this variable you can check to see what view is currently being drawn. In general, this is used to only render specific details to a single port when multiple view ports are visible in the room at the same time. See the example code below.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_enabled" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable controls whether any view ports that are visible within the room are enabled or not. If you have view ports set to visible and then disable this option, the whole room will be drawn to the screen scaled to the window size instead of the different cameras being drawn through the view ports.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_hport" Type="Array[Real]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable can be used to get or to set the height of the specified view port. The height of the view port (or combined view ports if more than one are active) define the height of the game window or background canvas at the start of the game, so changing this value after the game has started will have no visible effect on the game window size unless called along with the function window_set_size(). If you have a larger or smaller port size than that assigned to the camera, then the camera view will be scaled down - or up - to fit, as illustrated by the image below.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_surface_id" Type="Array[Id.Surface]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">With this variable you can set the contents of a given view port to draw to a surface, or get the current surface id if one has been assigned to a view port. When working with surfaces, it is often required that you capture the whole visible region of the screen to the surface, and so you would assign it to a view port using this variable. This means that everything that is shown in the chosen view will now be drawn to the assigned surface. The view will now not be drawn to the screen, meaning that you will need to either:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_visible" Type="Array[Bool]" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable can be used to find out if a particular view port is currently visible or not. You can also set this variable to effectively turn &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; a view by setting the value to true (visible) or false (invisible). Note that even if you have a view port set to visible, if view ports are not enabled (using the built-in variable view_enabled or enabling them in the Room Editor) then they will not be drawn to the screen.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_wport" Type="Array[Real]" Deprecated="true" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable can be used to get or to set the width of the specified view port. The width of the view port (or combined view ports if more than one are active) define the width of the game window or background canvas at the start of the game, so changing this value after the game has started will have no visible effect on the game window size unless called along with the function window_set_size(). If you have a larger or smaller port size than that assigned to the camera, then the camera view will be scaled down - or up - to fit, as illustrated by the image below.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_xport" Type="Array[Real]" Deprecated="true" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">With this built in array you can get or set the x position of the given view port. The view port is the area on the screen where the view is drawn, and you can have up to 8 active at any one time (the array is values from 0 to 7 inclusive to give 8 ports). Now, the default for GameMaker is that the game window (or background canvas) is the same size as the room, however when you activate view ports and cameras, this behaviour changes and the total size of the bounding box for all view ports is used. So, if you have two different view ports at two different positions, the total area that they cover defines the size of the game window. The following image illustrates this:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="view_yport" Type="Array[Real]" Deprecated="true" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">With this built in array you can get or set the y position of the given view port. The view port is the area on the screen where the view is drawn, and you can have up to 8 active at any one time (the array is values from 0 to 7 inclusive to give 8 ports). Now, the default for GameMaker is that the game window (or background canvas) is the same size as the room, however when you activate view ports and cameras, this behaviour changes and the total size of the bounding box for all view ports is used. So, if you have two different view ports at two different positions, the total area that they cover defines the size of the game window. The following image illustrates this:</Variable>
		<Variable Name="debug_mode" Type="Bool" Deprecated="true" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns true when the game is being played in debug mode and false when being played as normal.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="fps" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">In GameMaker there are two main ways that can be used to tell the speed at which your game runs. The game speed (as specified in the Game Options) and the fps (frames per second). These values are often confused, but basically one is the number of game steps that GameMaker is supposed to be completing in a second, while the other (the fps) is the number of CPU steps that GameMaker is actually completing in a second up to a maximum value of the room speed itself. To get the true fps, ie. the actual number of cpu steps per game step, use the fps_real variable.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="fps_real" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">In GameMaker there are two main ways that can be used to tell the speed at which your game runs. The game speed (as specified in the Game Options) and the fps (frames per second). These values are often confused, but basically one is the number of game steps that GameMaker is supposed to be completing in a second (game speed), while the other is the number of CPU steps that GameMaker is actually completing in a second (the real fps), and this value is generally much higher than the game speed, but will drop as your game gets more complex and uses more processing power to maintain the set room speed.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="application_surface" Type="Id.Surface" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This global scope, built-in variable can be used to access the application surface using any of the surface functions. This surface is permanently available and is where the bulk of drawing is done by GameMaker.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="program_directory" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This will return the directory where the game executable is stored. However this may not always be useful, particularly as some devices run the exe from a *.zip file, so this would return the same no matter where the game is actually running from.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="temp_directory" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This can be used to return the temporary directory created for your game each time it is run (the root does not contain the final &quot;\&quot;). This directory will hold files and can be accessed while the game is running, but it will be removed (along with all files that it contains) when the game is closed.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="working_directory" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">Working_directory can actually return two different values depending on what you are using it for. If you are writing a file to disk, working_directory points to the area of local storage that is reserved for your game on the target device (in windows this is &quot;%LOCALAPPDATA%/gamedir/&quot; where the &quot;gamedir&quot; is the directory with the name of your game). However, when reading from disk, working_directory can be either the local storage or the area where the included files are stored.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="event_data" Type="Id.DsMap" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This variable is global in scope and is used to hold a DS Map when used in the Gesture Events, and -1 at all other times. The actual contents of the DS map will depend on the type of gesture event that triggered it, so refer to the individual sections for those events.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="keyboard_key" Type="Constant.VirtualKey" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">With this variable you can get the keycode of the key that is currently being pressed and it will return 0 if no key is being pressed when the check is done.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="keyboard_lastchar" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable stores a string of the last key pressed. This variable is not read only and you can change it, for example to set it to &quot;&quot; (an empty string) if you handled it already.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="keyboard_lastkey" Type="Constant.VirtualKey" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable refers to the value that keyboard_key was in the previous frame, returning the keycode of that key (all standard keycode constants are returned). This variable is not read only and you can change it, for example to set it to -1 if you handled it already.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="keyboard_string" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable holds a string containing the last (at most) 1024 characters typed on the keyboard. This string will only contain printable characters typed, but it will correctly respond to pressing the backspace key by erasing the last character. This variable is not read only and you can change it, for example to set it to &quot;&quot; (an empty string) if you handled it already, and you can use the String Functions to manipulate it. Note that when using the on-screen Virtual Keyboard, only this variable will be updated with the keyboard input.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="mouse_button" Type="Constant.MouseButton" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the mouse button that is currently being pressed (currently, as in, this step) and can return any of the special mouse constants except mb_any.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="mouse_lastbutton" Type="Constant.MouseButton" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">This variable returns the last mouse button that was pressed and can return any of the special mouse constants except mb_any (you may also set this variable to one of the constants).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="mouse_x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read-only variable returns the current x axis position of the mouse within the room.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="mouse_y" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read-only variable returns the current y axis position of the mouse within the room.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="cursor_sprite" Type="Asset.GMSprite" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="false">Setting this variable will instruct GameMaker to use the designated sprite as a cursor (basically setting it to the current mouse x/y position every step). The default value is -1 which is no sprite for the cursor, but you can assign any sprite index from the game assets or that has been imported from an external resource. Please note that there is no way to control the animation speed or image_index, so if the sprite has sub-images, these will be cycled at the same speed as the room speed. To remove the cursor sprite, you can set this variable to -1 again.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="game_display_name" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the display name of your game for the target platform, as set in the Game Options.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="game_id" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the unique identifier for the game you have created. You can use this if you need a unique file name, or anything else that needs something to identify your game only. This can be set in the Game Options.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="game_project_name" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable returns the display name of your game for the target platform in a &quot;save-friendly&quot; format for the target platform. If the display name contains any characters that are not permitted for a file name, they will be replaced automatically with &quot;_&quot;. The display name can be set in the Game Options. Note that since there are no restrictions on file names for HTML5, this string will probably be the same as that returned by game_display_name.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="game_save_id" Type="String" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read-only variable will return the full path ID of the directory that is used by your game to save files to.

		<Variable Name="current_weekday" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable will return the weekday as a value, where Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="current_year" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read only variable will return the current year.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="delta_time" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">The purpose of delta timing is to eliminate the effects of the lag or slowness of computers that try to handle complex graphics or a lot of code. It is a value that can be added on to the speed of objects so that they will eventually move at the same speed, regardless of lag. This is achieved in GameMaker by using the read only variable delta_time every step as it measures the time that has passed between one step and the next in microseconds (1microsecond is 1,000,000th of a second). Therefore the variable delta_time can be used to calculate how much faster (for example) a game character has to move to make up for a lag spike in the game.</Variable>

		<Variable Name="os_device" Type="Constant.DeviceType" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read-only variable holds one of various constant values listed below to tell you which device you are currently running the game on. Note this variable is deprecated in favour of the function os_get_info() which returns more accurate information on the device running the game.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="os_type" Type="Constant.OperatingSystem" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This read-only variable holds one of various constant GameMaker has to tell you which operating system the game has been created for. Note that this is not necessarily the same as the OS of the device running it, since - for example - your game could be running on an Amazon Fire OS, but will have been built for the Android platform (in which case os_type will be os_android).</Variable>

		<Variable Name="phy_active" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable controls whether or not the instance is currently &quot;active&quot;. Setting it to false will prevent the instance from participating in the physics world, and setting it to true will have it participating again. Please note that this is not the same as deactivating the instance, as the instance is still visible on the screen and can still be changed through code, rather this function just prevents it from participating in the physics simulation</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_angular_damping" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to set the angular damping of the instance, or it can be used to get the current angular damping. The damping is the amount of &quot;resistance&quot; to angular rotation that the physics enabled instance has, with a lower value permitting the instance to rotate faster after a collision (for example) and a higher value making it require a more forceful push and rotate slower</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_angular_velocity" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to set the angular velocity of the instance, or it can be used to get the current angular velocity, in degrees per second and the value used can be either positive (for clockwise rotation) or negative (for anticlockwise rotation). If you set this on an instance that was previously static (ie: it has a density of 0) it will become a kinematic object and begin rotating</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_bullet" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable defines whether or not the instance is extremely fast moving (for example a bullet). The default value is false but if set to true this tells GameMaker that the instance will be moving at such high speeds that it will require more expensive collision detection to ensure it doesn&apos;t pass through other instances undetected</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_collision_points" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the number of points of collision detected between the two objects in the collision</Variable>

		<Variable Name="phy_col_normal_x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the x component of the collision normal corresponding to the phy_collision_x array value. For each contact point there is an associated contact normal (which is usually the same normal for all points of contact in the collision). This contact normal is a unit vector that points from one instance in the collision to another, and can be used, for example, to calculate the correct &quot;push&quot; direction to resolve collisions</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_col_normal_y" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the y component of the collision normal corresponding to the phy_collision_y array value. For each contact point there is an associated contact normal (which is usually the same normal for all points of contact in the collision). This contact normal is a unit vector that points from one instance in the collision to another, and can be used, for example, to calculate the correct &quot;push&quot; direction to resolve collisions</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_com_x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable will return the x position of the instance&apos;s center of mass. This is calculated automatically based on the density, inertia and mass of the instance as defined by the appropriate functions</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_com_y" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable will return the y position of the instance&apos;s center of mass. This is calculated automatically based on the density, inertia and mass of the instance as defined by the appropriate functions</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_dynamic" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">A dynamic instance is one that is fully simulated within the physics world and this read-only variable will return true if the instance being checked is fully simulated or false if it is not</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_fixed_rotation" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to set whether or not the instance can be affected by rotational forces (default is false). If this is set to true, no external force (either from coded impulses or forces, or from collisions) will affect the rotation value of the instance and this would have to be set manually using the phy_rotation variable</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_inertia" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">Inertia is the measure of how hard it is to make something start or stop moving, so the lower the value for this read-only variable and the easier it will be to set the instance in motion, while higher values will require more force to start it moving</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_kinematic" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable will return true if the instance is classed as being a kinematic object, or false if it is not. A kinematic instance is one that has infinite mass (a density of 0) but can move. So, to make an instance kinematic, you would first create a static instance and then set one or more of the instance variables related to movement (ie: phy_speed_x, phy_speed_y, or phy_angular_velocity)</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_linear_damping" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to set the linear damping of the instance, or it can be used to get the current linear damping. The damping is the amount of &quot;resistance&quot; to forward movement that the physics enabled instance has, with a lower value permitting the instance to move and accelerate faster and a higher value making it require a more forceful push</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_linear_velocity_x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get or change the x component of the instance&apos;s linear velocity vector and is defined in pixels per second (for pixels per step, see phy_speed_x). Altering this for a static instance (ie: an instance with 0 density) will turn it into a kinematic instance</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_linear_velocity_y" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get or change the y component of the instance&apos;s linear velocity vector and is defined in pixels per second (for pixels per step, see phy_speed_y). Altering this for a static instance (ie: an instance with 0 density) will turn it into a kinematic instance</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_mass" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the mass of the instance in kilograms. This value is calculated automatically based on the surface area of the assigned fixtures and their density values, but it can be changed using the function physics_mass_properties().</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_position_x" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get (or to set) the x position of the instance within the game room physics world.

Please note that the physics world may present errors when instances are moved by directly setting this variable as it will interrupt the continuous simulation. This variable is the physics equivalent of the instance variable y.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_position_yprevious" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get (or to set) the previous y position of the instance within the game room physics world. This is the position of the instance within the physics world in the previous step to the current one</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_rotation" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="true" Instance="true">This variable can be used to get (or to set) the angle of the instances fixture in degrees, similar to setting or getting the image_angle. However note that in the physics world rotations are calculated in the opposite way to the normal GameMaker game world, meaning that vector functions like point_direction()should have their return values modified (simply making positive to negative should resolve this).</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_sleeping" Type="Bool" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns whether or not the instance is currently &quot;sleeping&quot; (true) or not (false), A &quot;sleeping&quot; instance is one that is not actively engaged in any physical simulation. GameMaker will put objects to sleep to save simulation cycles when an instance is at rest and not in collision with another instance</Variable>
		<Variable Name="phy_speed" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="true">This read-only variable returns the current speed of the physics enabled instance, defined in pixels per step. Should you need to change this value, you must do so by changing the x and y vectors using the variables phy_speed_x and phy_speed_y.</Variable>

Altering this for a static instance (ie: an instance with 0 density) will turn it into a kinematic instance.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="browser_height" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This variable holds the height (in pixels) of the browser the game is being run in. If no browser is present then the window size is returned. the following image illustrates how this variable relates to the rest of the positioning functions available through the Window Functions.</Variable>
		<Variable Name="browser_width" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Get="true" Set="false" Instance="false">This variable holds the width (in pixels) of the browser the game is being run in.

		<Constant Name="phy_particle_flag_spring" Class="PhysicsParticleFlag" Type="Real" Deprecated="false">Spring particles produce the effect of being attached to one another, as if by a spring. Particles created with this flag are &quot;connected&quot; in pairs, with each particle being connected to the one that was closest to it at the time of creation. 			 Once paired, particles do not change &quot;partners&quot; , and the farther an external force pulls them from one another, the greater the power with which they will collide when that external force is removed.

		<Constant Name="phy_particle_flag_tensile" Class="PhysicsParticleFlag" Type="Real" Deprecated="false">Tensile particles are used to produce the effect of surface tension, or the taut curvature on the surface of a body of liquid. They might be used, for example, to create the surface tension you would see on a drop of water. Once the tension is 			 broken, the particles bounce as if they were elastic, but also continue to attract each other. As a result, particles tend to form clusters as they bounce.</Constant>
		<Constant Name="phy_particle_flag_colourmixing" Class="PhysicsParticleFlag" Type="Real" Deprecated="false" Locale="GB">Colour-mixing particles take on some of the colour of other particles with which they collide.

		<Structure Name="Sequence">
			<Field Name="name" Type="String" Get="true" Set="true">This is the name of the sequence as a string and you can get or set this value as required. Note that sequences created using the function sequence_create() will not have a name and this will simply be an empty string &quot;&quot;.</Field>
			<Field Name="loopmode" Type="Constant.SeqPlay" Get="true" Set="true">This is the playback mode of the sequence object and can be get or set.</Field>
			<Field Name="playbackSpeed" Type="Real" Get="true" Set="true">This specifies the playback speed of the sequence, which is interpreted as either frames-per-second or frames-per-game-frame depending on the playbackSpeedType (see below). You can get or set this value.</Field>
			<Field Name="playbackSpeedType" Type="Constant.SpriteSpeed" Get="true" Set="true">This specifies how the playbackSpeed should be interpreted and you can get or set this value.</Field>
			<Field Name="length" Type="Real" Get="true" Set="true">The length of the sequence in frames. You can get or set this value, but note that making a sequence shorter may cause issues if a sequence instance referencing this sequence has its playhead set to past the new length.</Field>
			<Field Name="volume" Type="Real" Get="true" Set="true">This is a scalar value from 0 to 1 that is used to scale the volume of all audio tracks in the sequence. You can get or set this value and it will modify the global audio output for all tracks - for example, if you have an audio track with a volume of 0.8 and then set the sequence volume property to 0.5, the audio track will have a final volume of 0.4.</Field>
			<Field Name="xorigin" Type="Real" Get="true" Set="true">This is the origin of the sequence along the X axis.</Field>
			<Field Name="yorigin" Type="Real" Get="true" Set="true">This is the origin of the sequence along the Y axis.</Field>
			<Field Name="messageEventKeyframes" Type="Array" Get="true" Set="true">This allows access to the message event keyframes for the sequence. You can get or set these message events, and when getting this property an array of keyframe structs is returned, and for setting the property you           should supply an array of keyframe structs. For more information, please see the page on Sequence Events and Moments.</Field>
			<Field Name="momentKeyframes" Type="Array" Get="true" Set="true">This allows access to the moment event keyframes for the sequence. You can get or set these moment events, and when getting this property an array of keyframe structs is returned, and for setting the property you should supply           an array of keyframe structs. For more information, please see the page on Sequence Events and Moments.</Field>
			<Field Name="tracks" Type="Array" Get="true" Set="true">This allows access to the list of asset tracks on the top level of the sequence. You can get or set this property, and when getting this property an array of track structs is returned, and for setting the property you should           supply an array of track structs. For more information, please see the section on Track Structs.</Field>
