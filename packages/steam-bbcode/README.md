# Steam BBCode Generator

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) has been around for a while, and many part of its content management system still [use legacy BBCode formats](https://steamcommunity.com/comment/ForumTopic/formattinghelp). This tool helps generate Steam-compatible BBCode from Markdown.

Note: currently only supports _pure_ Markdown (embedded HTML is left as-is).
